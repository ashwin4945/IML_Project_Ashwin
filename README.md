# IML_Project_Ashwin

This is a Naive Bayesian classifier. We have used the classifier model to classify statements as positive or negative.
For instance Ashwin is happy today is a positive statement and Ravi did not complete his assignment is a negative statement.

We have got the accuracy of the model as 0.8

This project was completed under the guidance of Mayura D Tapkire, Assistant Professor, Dept. of IS&E, NIE Mysuru.
