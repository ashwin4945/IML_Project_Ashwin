# IML_Project_Ashwin

Problem Statement:
Assuming a set of documents that need to be classified, use the naive Bayesian Classifier model to perform this task.
(Hint: Built-in Java classes/API can be used to write the program) Calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall for your data set.

This is a Naive Bayesian classifier. We have used the classifier model to classify statements as positive or negative.
For instance Ashwin is happy today is a positive statement and Ravi did not complete his assignment is a negative statement.

We have got the accuracy of the model as 0.8
